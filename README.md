### Warehouse Management System

I have used Spring Boot (Java) framework to build the Rest API. I have used Hibernate as ORM framework for building models and schemas in the database.
I have used maven as a build tool for managing dependencies in the project. I have created some Dockerfile as well for the project. I have implemented all the features mentioned in the description and handled all the errors and exceptions with 
appropriate status codes.

The application will run on port 8080. Before running the application please be sure to change the mysql data source properties in the application.properties

You can run following commands to download the dependencies:
#### mvn clean install
#### mvn clean compile
#### mvn clean package
